# Getting started with Alexa Skills

Before we start creating an alexa skill, we will need to do the following:

## Create an AWS account
### This is where we will create our lambda function to integrate with our alexa device.

1. Navigate to https://aws.amazon.com/
2. Click "Create Free Account"
3. When asked to select a tier, for this tutorial we can go ahead and select "Always Free"
4. Select "personal account" and fill out the information for this account 
5. Once successful, you will be able to navigate around your AWS dashboard


## Create an Alexa Developer Account
Sign up for an account on the Alexa developer console. The console is where you will build and optimize your skill. 

1. Navigate here to create your developer account: [Alexa Skills Developer Console](https://www.amazon.com/ap/register?clientContext=131-0331464-9465436&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&siteState=clientContext%3D142-6935021-1894360%2CsourceUrl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fdeveloper.amazon.com%252Falexa%2Csignature%3Doyixlki7Yxz8bRUtt4vGJ4EugQ8j3D&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&language=en_US&pageId=amzn_developer_portal&openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.amazon.com%2Falexa&prevRID=HSRBQ1KHA4E5D1PBHPPP&openid.assoc_handle=mas_dev_portal&openid.mode=checkid_setup&prepopulatedLoginId=&failedSignInCount=0&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0)


## Once you have done these two things, we will be ready to build our first skill!
